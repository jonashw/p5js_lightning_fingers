## Mandatory libraries

For this sketch to work, you must install the p5 library and add-ons *here* **yourself**.  This directory must contain the following:

- `p5/p5.min.js` 
- `p5/addons/p5.dom.min.js`
- `p5/addons/p5.sound.min.js`

## Simplest install

Simply download the "Complete Library" from https://p5js.org/download/ and then unzip it into this directory.  

Watch out for the `__MACOSX` folder if you're on Windows!
